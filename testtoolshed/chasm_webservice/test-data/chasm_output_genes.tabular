#Gene Level Analysis Report
#2014-08-28 22:54:22.487967
#CRAVAT version: 3.1
#Analysis done at http://www.cravat.us.
#Input file: dataset_1.dat
#This report shows analysis results at gene level.
#The composite p-value (Stouffer's combined p-value) and composite FDR of a gene show how probable it is to get the same p-value distribution for the gene as that obtained from the input variants by chance.
#Input coordinate was hg19 genomic.
#Tissue type for CHASM analysis: Other
